<n2>Summary</n2></br>
<t2>The Independent forecaster, the Office for the Budget Responsibility (OBR), has provided a draft to forecast to Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng. The draft forecast the OBR has provided doesn't include the impact of the energy bill help. The OBR has offered to provide a forecast including this impact, but that has been rejected by the Treasury. This has raised concerns that the Government's tax and spending policies are not thought out, increasing predictions that the UK is heading for a recession. MPs on the Treasury Select Committee have written to Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng to seek assurancethat the forecast will be published. The Treasury did not offer such reassurances.</t2>
</br></br>
<n2>Why is this bad?</n2></br></br>
<t2>The Government is incapable of being transparent about basic facts. It is also an indication that the economic forecast is not looking good.</t2>

<n2>Summary</n2></br>
<t2>Mark Fullbrook (No. 10 Chief of Staff) is a political strategist and lobbyist, who has served under Margaret Thatcher, John Major, and  Liz Truss as Deputy Head of the Conservative Party, Head of Strategy, and Downing Street Chief of Staff. The Sante Group, to which he was adviser, was awarded a £680 million PPE grant during the Covid-19 pandemic. As Liz Truss's most senior adviser, he has a hand in shaping government policy. He has been interviewed by the FBI over his relationship with a banker who gave the governor of Puerto Rico $300,000 for her re-election campaign. The donation was allegedly made on the condition that she sacked the head of the Island's financial regulator. Several people have already been charged or convicted.</t2>
</br></br>
<n2>Why is this bad?</n2></br>
<t2>This is rather self explanatory. If Liz Truss's advisors are this dodgy, imagine how much they could damage the UK.</t2>

<n2>Summary</n2></br>

<t2>Sir Tom Scholar, the Treasury permanent secretary, was told he was no longer wanted in the job on Tuesday. Sir Tom had headed the Treasury since June 2016, and served with Rishi Sunak, Ms Truss’s Tory leadership rival, during his chancellorship. Mr Kwarteng dismissed him shortly after being appointed Chancellor, meaning it was one of his first acts in the role. Sir Tom’s sacking was severely criticised by Lord Macpherson, his predecessor as Treasury permanent secretary, who said “Tom Scholar is the best civil servant of his generation. Sacking him makes no sense. His experience would have been invaluable in the coming months as government policy places massive upward pressure on the cost of funding."</t2>
</br></br>

<n2>Why is this bad?</n2></br>
<t2>Tom Scholar was an excellent civil servant, who was an expert in finace an economics. He would have been excellent in the job now as we face such things as the cost of living crisis, and it makes no sense to sack him. Likely he said something the government didn't like, meaning his sacking risk the dangerous precedent of politicising the civil service.</t2>
